# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.12

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
python3 -m pipenv sync --dev
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/v3/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/v3/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:5000 openapi_server
```

## TEST

### With API

```PowerShell
start http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v3/ui
```

### With command lines

#### To add a User:

```PowerShell
